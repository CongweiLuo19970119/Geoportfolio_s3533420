			A brief introduction about myself is that I am born and raised in Shanghai, China on 19 of January 1997, I am in my fourth and final year of the 
			Bachelor of Science (Surveying) (Honours) course. My surveying-related interests is working with creat maps in ArcGIS Pro , collection and analysis of
			the output of Trimble Business center, and creating 3D generations of models using spatial data. My favourite surveying sujects are cartography,
			Advanced Imaging Technology and Earth Observation Sciecne. They all belong to courses of geospatial and involve plenty of geospatial knowledge.

		My own personal hobbies include swimming and travelling! More detailed information can be found in the About page!

	<div class="academic-intro">
		Cartography is the art and science of representing geographical areas graphically, usually on a flat surface such as a map or chart. The Cartography
		design is the process of making a map's appearance, applying design principles and knowledge of map usage to create maps that are both aesthetically appealing and functional.
		It includes scale, projection, spatial relationship, generalization, and symbolization and data modeling.  Map production involves the application of elements of science and art, 
		combining graphic talent and expertise in editing and design principles with available technologies for product generation.I learned professional map making skills that will allow
		me to design convincing maps from a range of spatial data from this course.

	<!--SUBJECT 2-->

	<div class="bar"><h2>Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT)</h2></div> <!-- #ID# #SUBJECT# Change the text to fit a subject you gave done yourself-->
	<div class="academic-intro">
		Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) sets on the core concepts of remote sensing and photogrammetry and allows you to explore more advanced
		 topics in the field. I studied the principles and techniques for extracting measurements of physical features and 
		 other useful information from imagery data. I learned methods of work with different types of imagery data collected by diverse imagery sensors and
		 extract semantic information as well as spatial information. 
		<ul>
			
			The subject taught
		   skills from three different Softwares:
			
		   <li>AgiSoft Metashape</li>
			<li>Pix4D Mapper</li>
			<li>ArcGIS Pro</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			For the 2023 version of the course which I completed, the assignments of this was about the concepts of photogrammetry and Lidar. 
			It improve my level of operate softwares and ability of collbrated. 
			It consists of 4 Assignemnts cover cotents of photogrammentry and Lidar:
		<ul>
			
			<li>Aerial Triangulation using Pix4D</li>
			<li>Produce a dense point cloud model using
				Structure from Motion (SfM)</li>
			<li>Point cloud exploration and basic analytics</li>
			<li>Extracting 3D building models from point cloud</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
		</p>In the practical of Aerial Triangulation, I created a terrain model and orthomosaic of a small area, after performing an 
		SfM bundle adjustment of a block of photographs. The practical session was designed so that I can work from home if they need to and
		complete the session on my own computer. 

		In the practical of create dense point cloud model, I used close-range photogrammetry to build a model of the entrance to the Old Melbourne Gaol. 
		I will capture my own images and processing them using Metashape, an SfM package used in the industry.  the session will start outside at the entrance 
		to the Old Melbourne Gaol, as shown on the map below. This is on Victoria Street, just near the Coffee Nomad cart. 

		The purpose of point cloud exploration and basic analytics is to familiarize students with point cloud data. On exercising this practical,
		I had basic understanding of LAS Dataset and be able to use ArcGIS pro to explore and perform some basic analytics tasks on it. I understand 
		convepts of DSM, DTM and different ways to visualize them. 

		The purpose of extract 3D building models is to use lidar point cloud data in ArcGIS Pro for a real-world application, extracting the 3D 
		representation of buildings. I completed based on what you have already learned in the practical exercise and some more features in ArcGIS
		Pro which are introduced in this assignment. I learned methods of extract the realistic 3D representation of building footprints from the 
		LiDAR point cloud dataset.

	<div class="academic-intro">
		This page will briefly cover all my study experience (as of 2020) within the Earth observstion science course. 
		This course introduced the basic principles of Earth Observation Science to me. The course includes the development of 
		the technologies and covers fundamental concepts of Earth Observation. This course incorporated the theory and practices 
		of using remotely sensed data for Earth Observation. I learned about the basic principles of Earth Observation, image enhancement 
		and interpretation, satellite systems, classifications, and active remote sensing. I also developed a solid foundation in the theory
		and practical skills for Earth Observation through remotely sensed data. This course required students to adopt advance softwares 
		(Erdas ER Mapper,Trimble Business Center).

		This practical exercise provided experience with some basic exercises in mission planning and image measurement, and is designed to support 
		and reinforce the material covered in lectures. The mission planning exercise is based on photography from an unmanned aircraft system (UAS), 
		also known as a UAV, RPAS or drone. The image precision test is based on scanned aerial photography.
		 
		<p>
			This pracical had 2 parts of exercise. The first part is based on ArduPilot Mission Planner and I learned how to use this software to 
		create a mission plan that is an integral task in the use of UAS to capture spatial data. The second part is based on Erdas 
		ER Mapper and I investigated the factors that affect the precision of image measurements.

		 The second exercise generates a 3D model based on photography from an unmanned aircraft system (UAS), also known as a UAV, RPAS or drone.

		</p>
		I adopteded Trimble business center (TBC) to solved requirements of 3D  mapping. The practical exercise makes use of
		Trimble Business Centre and a 3D city model. Trimble Business Centre must be downloaded
		and installed on a Windows PC. Thus I downloaded some project data for Trimble
		Business Centre.
